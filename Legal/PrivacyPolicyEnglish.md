This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you may provide in the "AWattPrice" mobile application and website ("Mobile Application" and "Service") is collected, protected and used. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you" or "your") and this Mobile Application developer ("Operator", "we", "us" or "our"). By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

### Automatic collection of information

When you use the Mobile Application, our servers automatically record information that your device sends.

### Collection of information

When sending an e-mail to any of our addresses we will collect any information provided in this message (also see section in "Collection of personal information").

If you allow AWattPrice notifications we will need to collect certain information to provide you with this service:

- An Apple Push Notification Service device token ("APNs token"). This APNs token doesn't allow us to identify you as a specific user, as it could change anytime (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/registering_your_app_with_apns).
- Settings specified by you inside AWattPrice.

### Collection of personal information

You can access and use the Mobile Application and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features in the Mobile Application, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any online forms in the Mobile Application.

Currently the collection of Personal Information includes:

- Any personal information (i.e.: e-mail address, name, ...) provided when sending an e-mail to any of our addresses.
